Verify the elements of Job Stories for accuracy and the absence of assumptions, and check their internal consistency, preserving, clarifying, or excluding unreliable unconfirmed formulations.

For verification, take the incoming Job Stories, the corresponding extended list of quotes from which they were formulated, and the original interview text on which they were based.

# Verification process
1.For problems and desired/undesired outcomes:
- Match with quotes from the extended list
- Find additional confirming/refuting quotes in the original interview text
- Check direct and indirect confirmations of formulations
2.For other elements of the Job Story:
- Find additional confirming/refuting quotes in the original interview text
- Check direct and indirect confirmations of element formulations in quotes
3.Check internal connections between elements of the same Job Story for consistency:
- Correspondence of emotional states to the described problem
- Logical connection between avoidance and achievement results
- Consistency of achievement criteria with desired results
- Correspondence of drivers and barriers to the described situation
4. Classification of elements by level of confirmation:
- Direct confirmation by quotes
- Indirect confirmation through context
- Lack of confirmation

#Processing rules
1. If there are direct confirmations of an element, retain its formulation
2. If there are indirect confirmations of an element, clarify its formulation
3. Exclude elements of JOB STORIES only in the complete absence of direct or indirect confirmations. When excluding, replace the element's value with "No data."
Important! Ensure there are no empty values, only "No data" values
4.For assessments and metrics that have direct or indirect confirmation in the interview, retain them
5.Exclude assessments and metrics that do not have confirmation in the interview, leaving an empty value

# Priority
When choosing formulations, choose those that have direct confirmation in the interview

# Output format
Provide verified JOB STORIES with updated elements in the same format as the incoming JOB STORIES

   1. Text number <text_number> **Problem 1**
    "Quote" (respondent's name, timing of the fragment(s))
    Job Story 1 with fields strictly according to the format above
   2. Text number <text_number> **Problem 2**
      And so on...

The number of JOB STORIES should equal the number of incoming JOB STORIES and be arranged in the same order
Elements of JOB STORIES are arranged strictly in the same order as in the incoming JOB STORIES

The order of elements in each JOB STORY:
- Text number <text_number>
- Problem: <brief title of the current problem>
- Problem description: <description of the current situation>
- Quote: <supporting fragment> (respondent's name, timing)
- Negative emotional state: <how they feel now when the problem is unresolved>
- Want (Avoidance undesired result): <what they want to "escape from," related to the negative state>
- Want (Achievement desired result): <specific desired result the user wants to achieve>
- So that: <long-term goal/desired result>
- Desired positive emotional state: <how they want to feel>
- Importance of need: <rating 1-10>
- Frequency: <how often they encounter the problem>
- Events by which they will know the result is achieved (e.g., ideal day)
- Achievement deadline: <desired time frame for obtaining the result>
- Achievement criteria: <how they will know the result is achieved>
- Previous solutions and products the respondent used to achieve results
- Satisfaction with past solutions: <rating for each 1-10>
- Cost of past solutions (how much has already been paid)
- Reasons for dissatisfaction with solutions (triggers for refusal)
- Consequences/costs associated with not solving the problem: <time, money, energy>
- Drivers: <what inspires/motivates changes and achieving the desired result; subconscious fears that motivate changes>
- Barriers: <what prevents achieving the result>
- Ideal solution
- Respondent's name

# Final checks
1. Internal consistency of all elements
2. Absence of contradictions between elements
3. All quantitative indicators are confirmed by data from the interview
4. All formulations are based on actual interview data
5. Check the connection of elements with confirming quotes
6. Relevant respondent names are present
7. If there are no any confirmed elements in the Stories, then instead of them, the value "No data" is present, which means that all values of Stories are filled!
8. Important! Provide the answer strictly in English. If the text is in another language, translate it into English before providing it.

Important! Do not provide any additional comments from you! Only the result in the required format
