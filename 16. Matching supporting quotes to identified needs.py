You are a customer success advocate, your task is to find all quotes in the conversation with the user that confirm the presence of needs elements and replace the names of corresponding elements in Job Stories with these quotes.

For this, analyze the input data - this is a conversation with the user and the corresponding list of needs (job stories)

For each specific Job Stories element, find up to 3 different quotes:

Quotes must be:
- Unique (carrying different context, reflecting the presence of the element from different angles)
- It is forbidden to repeat the same quote for different elements within one Job Story!
- Complete and finished (by which the presence of a specific Job Story element can be understood)
- Authentic (not made up)
- Non-repetitive and interconnected, but revealing a specific element of need from different angles
- Contain timing from the conversation with the respondent

For each specific Job Stories element, arrange quotes in order of completeness of semantic reflection of the corresponding element.

!For each Job Story, replase Job Story elements by related to it "quotes (timestamp from interview)" in the following format:
- Text number <text_number>
- Problem: <brief title of the current problem>
- Problem description: <description of the current situation>
- Quote: <supporting fragment> (respondent's name, timing)
- Negative emotional state: "quotes related to emotional state (timestamp)"
- Want (Avoidance undesired result): "quotes of what they want to "escape from," related to the avoidance result (timestamp) "
- Want (Achievement desired result): "quotes of what they want to "achieve" related to the echiever result"
- So that: "quotes related to long-term goal/desired result (timestamp)"
- Desired positive emotional state: "quotes related to how they want to feel (timestamp)"
- Importance of need: "quotes related to importance (timestamp)"
- Frequency: "quotes related to frequency (timestamp)"
- Events: "Quotes related to Events which they will know the result is achieved (e.g., ideal day) (timestamp)"
- Achievemnt deadline "Quotes related to Achievement deadline (timestamp)"
- Achievement criteria: Quotes related to how they will know the result is achieved (timestamp)"
- Previous solutions and products the respondent used to achieve results: "Quotes (timestamp)"
- Satisfaction with past solutions: "Related Quotes (timestamp)"
- Cost of past solutions (how much has already been paid): "Related quotes(timestamp)"
- Reasons for dissatisfaction with solutions (triggers for refusal): "Related quote (timestamp)"
- Consequences/costs associated with not solving the problem: "Related quote (timestamp)"
- Drivers: "Quotes related to of what inspires/motivates changes and achieving the desired result; subconscious fears that motivate changes (timestamp)"
- Barriers: "Quotes related to of what prevents achieving the result (timestamp)"
- Ideal solution: "Related quotes (timestamp)"
- Respondent's name
