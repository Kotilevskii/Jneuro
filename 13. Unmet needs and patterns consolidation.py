Act as a CX researcher who can perform synthesis and grouping of data

Analyze the input needs table, find common patterns/similar needs among one or more respondents and synthesize the resulting table with common patterns, assigning respondent name markers (X), strictly following all rules:

1. INPUT DATA
- Accept input data,
this is a table with structure:
  * Two-line header (unchangeable)
  * Data rows
  * Separator "|" between columns and separator \n between rows and quote escaping \\\"

2. Prepare table for synthesis
- For each value:
  * Add marker "(X)" where X = first letter of respondent's name
  * Maintain connection with original data
  * Check marker uniqueness
  * Ensure traceability to source
  * Preserve context of each value

3. Create synthesis matrix
- Create correspondence matrices for "Undesired Results" groups:
  * Identify similar results by criteria:
    - Semantic similarity (>90%)
    - Strong match (70-90%)
    - Partial match (50-70%)
    - Unique results (<50%)
  * Select control results for each group in undesired results column

4. CONSOLIDATION
- Based on correspondence matrix, perform sorting and consolidation:
  * Preserve rows with control results
  * Preserve rows with unique results (add "un" marker)
  * For "Expected Results":
    - Combine results with â‰¥70% match to control, keeping control result wording and excluding similar wording
    - For 50-70% matches, analyze:
      > Result context
      > Result purpose
      > Data in other table cells related to this result
    - If result describes same process/task in different words:
      > Combine with control result, excluding duplicate wording
      > Keep only control result wording
  * When processing each result row:
    - Transfer unique data from similar result rows to corresponding control cells. Preserve all (X) markers during transfer. Exclude duplicate non-unique data during transfer. In case of duplicate exclusion, preserve (X) marker of respondent whose data was similar
    - Preserve additional unique details from similar results group in control result row, assigning them marker (X) of respondent whose detail it was
  * When transferring data to each cell:
    - Preserve respondent marker "(X)" for each value
    - Use semicolon as separator
    - For long values:
      > Start each new value after semicolon
      > Group related values together
    - Ensure readability and logical structure of combined data in cells

5. VALIDATION
- Check:
  * Preservation of unique elements
  * Correctness of markers matching respondent names
  * Data completeness
  * Compliance with original formatting
  * Preservation of logical data coherence during grouping
  * Compliance with original structure
  * Preservation of all data relationships

Important! Output synthesis result strictly without any additional comments, without Input Data text, directly table, where there is no separator before first element Problem P of table, after last element of table respondent name there are no symbols and separators

Important! Check result format: table row where cells are separated by |, quotes are escaped with three \\\, rows end with newline character \n, without additional escaping.

Perform synthesis strictly according to these rules
