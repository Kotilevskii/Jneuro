Take the incoming Job Stories. In each such Job Story, find the formulations of desired and undesired results. Verify the formulations for compliance with the following rules:

Achievement/Avoidance results must be:

0. Rational (describing a specific rational result that the user wants to achieve or avoid)
1. Unchanging over time and independent of specific solutions
2. Predictable/controllable (without specific numbers in the formulation)
3. Unambiguous in formulation
4. Formulated from the user's responsibility
5. Simple and understandable even to a novice in the methodology

Examples of correct and incorrect formulations
1. Unchanging over time and independence from solutions
Incorrect:
"Determine the horizontal line connecting the points of maximums and minimums of the price on the chart"
Reason: Tied to a specific solution (graphical analysis)
Correct:
"Determine the price above which market participants are not willing to sell the asset"
Reason: Describes an unchanging need, relevant even 1000 years ago
2. Predictability/controllability of the result
Incorrect:
"Reduce the risk of crop failure"
Reason: No specific object of control
Correct:
"Avoid crop failure due to untimely watering of the beds"
Reason: There is a clear object of control - timely watering
3. Unambiguity of formulation
Incorrect:
"Find a material with a good price-quality ratio"
Reason: "Good ratio" is a subjective concept
Correct:
"Quickly identify materials with the minimum cost that meet quality standards"
Reason: Clear criteria - cost and compliance with standards
4. User responsibility
Incorrect:
"Avoid the risk that the selected materials will not be in the store"
Reason: Availability of materials is outside the user's responsibility
Correct:
"Do not choose materials for a design project that are absent in the regional store"
Reason: Describes what the user controls themselves
5. Simplicity and clarity
Incorrect:
"Avoid the risk that consuming food elements above or below the body's required measure in nutrition will lead to the absence of desired changes in body shape/strength/% body fat"
Reason: Complex academic formulation
Correct:
"Do not overeat beyond measure, which would prevent achieving the desired body shape/weight"
Reason: Simple and clear formulation

Note: These examples serve as a guide. Correct formulations can be formulated differently and relate to other areas of product, use exaple to make compliance of formulations with the basic rules.

Follow these criteria for checking the formulation:
1. Does it contain solutions that did not exist 100+ years ago?
2. Is there a specific object of control that can be measured?
3. Does it describe something that the user can control themselves?
4. Is the formulation clear to someone unfamiliar with the methodology?
5. Does it contain subjective assessments ("good", "convenient", etc.)?

Note: These examples serve as a guide. Correct formulations can be formulated differently and relate to other areas of activity, the main thing is compliance with the basic principles.

Processing instructions
If the formulation does not comply with the rules, rephrase it
Check the relevance of the problem and the connection with other elements of the Job Story
If necessary, correct the formulation to match the rest of the elements

# Output format
Provide verified JOB STORIES with updated elements in the same format as the incoming JOB STORIES

   1. Text number <text_number> **Problem 1**
    "Quote" (respondent's name, timing of the fragment(s))
    Job Story 1 with fields strictly according to the format above
   2. Text number <text_number> **Problem 2**
      And so on...

The number of JOB STORIES should equal the number of incoming JOB STORIES and be arranged in the same order
Elements of JOB STORIES are arranged strictly in the same order as in the incoming JOB STORIES

The order of elements in each JOB STORY:
- Text number <text_number>
- Problem: <brief title of the current problem>
- Problem description: <description of the current situation>
- Quote: <supporting fragment> (respondent's name, timing)
- Negative emotional state: <how they feel now when the problem is unresolved>
- Want (Avoidance undesired result): <what they want to "escape from," related to the negative state>
- Want (Achievement desired result): <specific desired result the user wants to achieve>
- So that: <long-term goal/desired result>
- Desired positive emotional state: <how they want to feel>
- Importance of need: <rating 1-10>
- Frequency: <how often they encounter the problem>
- Events by which they will know the result is achieved (e.g., ideal day)
- Achievement deadline: <desired time frame for obtaining the result>
- Achievement criteria: <how they will know the result is achieved>
- Previous solutions and products the respondent used to achieve results
- Satisfaction with past solutions: <rating for each 1-10>
- Cost of past solutions (how much has already been paid)
- Reasons for dissatisfaction with solutions (triggers for refusal)
- Consequences/costs associated with not solving the problem: <time, money, energy>
- Drivers: <what inspires/motivates changes and achieving the desired result; subconscious fears that motivate changes>
- Barriers: <what prevents achieving the result>
- Ideal solution
- Respondent's name
