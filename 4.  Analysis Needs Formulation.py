For each problem/opportunity or user request and corresponding text fragments from the list {{#1730999938794.text#}}, formulate Job stories in the following format:
- Text number <text_number>
- Problem: <brief title of the current problem>
- Problem description: <description of the current situation>
- Quote: <supporting fragment> (respondent's name, timing)
- Negative emotional state: <how they feel now when the problem is unresolved>
- Want (Avoidance undesired result): <what they want to "escape from," related to the negative state>
- Want (Achievement desired result): <specific desired result the user wants to achieve>
- So that: <long-term goal/desired result>
- Desired positive emotional state: <how they want to feel>
- Importance of need: <rating 1-10>
- Frequency: <how often they encounter the problem>
- Events by which they will know the result is achieved (e.g., ideal day)
- Achievement deadline: <desired time frame for obtaining the result>
- Achievement criteria: <how they will know the result is achieved>
- Previous solutions and products the respondent used to achieve results
- Satisfaction with past solutions: <rating for each 1-10>
- Cost of past solutions (how much has already been paid)
- Reasons for dissatisfaction with solutions (triggers for refusal)
- Consequences/costs associated with not solving the problem: <time, money, energy>

0. RULES FOR FORMULATING DESIRED/UNDESIRED RESULTS IN JOB STORIES:

Achievement/Avoidance results must be:
- Timeless and solution-independent (the need remains even when solutions change)
- Predictable/manageable (reflects what the user wants to achieve/avoid without specific numbers)
- Unambiguous in formulation
- Formulated from the user's responsibility
- Simply and clearly stated

Structure of result formulations:
Direction of change + Measure of change (without specific numbers) + Object of control
IMPORTANT: Do not include solutions or methods of achieving results in the formulation of results
1. Formulate Job Stories for each problem and corresponding quote without making assumptions from the list in the proposed structure
2. Do not make up missing data for filling out job stories, only take from {{#1730999591721.item#}}

3. Provide the answer strictly in the structure:

   1. Text number <text_number> **Problem 1**
    "Quote" (respondent's name, timing of the fragment(s))
    Job Story with fields strictly according to the format above
   2. Text number <text_number> **Problem 2**
      And so on...

# final checks
0. Before each Job Story, the number of the analyzed text <text_number> is indicated. This number is the same for each story!
1. The number of Job Stories equals the number of identified problems, and the stories should not be duplicated and must be unique (describing unique situations). In case of duplication, exclude non-unique ones.
2. Each Job Story contains all fields in the specified order.
3. Data is taken from the interview, not invented.
4. The format strictly corresponds to the structure, and all elements are filled only if relevant data is found in the interview, without making assumptions.
5. Achievement criteria are measurable.
6. Emotional states are clearly described.
7. Achievement deadlines are specific, only if data is found in the interview.
8. Consequences/costs are expressed in measurable quantities, only if data is found in the interview.
9. Quotes are indicated with (respondent's name, timing of the fragment(s)).
10. Desired and undesired results include specific rational results, and emotional needs describe the person's emotions and emotional states, not vice versa.

Important! Provide the answer strictly in English. If the text is in another language, translate it into English before providing it.
