Analyze the input text and formulate the user's main Job using the formula <functional action + action object + context>, for example, "invest/buy crypto when I'm a beginner/online" or "order a taxi while traveling abroad" or "book a hotel for a relative." Do not invent a task, but determine it from the semantic analysis of the text.
Find all fragments in the input text where the respondent:
Explicitly talks about problems and pains and answers questions about desired/undesired outcomes related to these problems.
Text fragments should reflect expected outcomes - what the user wants to achieve or avoid, regardless of specific solutions. These expected outcomes form the basis for formulating Job Stories. Fragments should be complete and carry context so that knowing only them, one can formulate expected outcomes.

Expected outcome:
I. Unchanging (over time) and independent of solutions (solutions change, the need remains)
II. Predictable and manageable. Reflects an undesirable event (control object), after which the user will inevitably be dissatisfied, so their task (need) will not be fulfilled or will be fulfilled with difficulties. Or reflects what the user wants to achieve (control object), for which they hire a specific product functionality.
III. Returns responsibility to the user
IV. Has no ambiguous interpretation
V. Simply formulated (ideally understandable even to a child)
Contains
(1) Direction of changes + Measure of changes + (2) Control object (without a number inside)
Does not include existing solution or method in its formulation.
Formulate concisely for each fragment or group of fragments in one sentence the user's problem.

Provide the answer in a numbered list strictly in the format, strictly in English:

1. Text number: <text_number>; User's problem 1
    "Fragment or several complete fragments of text reflecting the presence of a problem/request or potential opportunity by which a separate corresponding expected result can be determined" (respondent's name, fragment timing){
2. Text number: <text_number>; Problem 2
3...
N
where <text_number> - the number of the analyzed input text
Ensure that the number of problems matches the number of clarifying questions about expected outcomes, but not less than 5 if there are fewer clarifying questions in the interview.
For each problem, ensure that there are 1-2 confirming quotes presented, by which the formulations of expected outcomes can be revealed.
Important! Provide the result strictly in English. If the text is in another language, translate it into English before providing it.
